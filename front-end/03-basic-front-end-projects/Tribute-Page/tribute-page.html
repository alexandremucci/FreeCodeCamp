                    <h4>Biography</h4>
                    <hr class="standardLine">
                    <p class="justified-text"> Irena Sendler was born as Irena Krzyżanowska on 15 February 1910 in Warsaw to Dr. Stanisław Krzyżanowski, a physician, and his wife, Janina. She grew up in Otwock, a town about 15 miles southeast of Warsaw, where there was a vibrant Jewish community. Her father died in February 1917 from typhus contracted while treating patients. After his death, Jewish community leaders offered to help her mother pay for Sendler's education, though her mother declined their assistance. Sendler studied Polish literature at Warsaw University, and joined the Polish Socialist Party.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h4>World War II</h4>
                    <hr class="standardLine">
                    <p class="justified-text"> Sendler moved to Warsaw prior to the outbreak of World War II, and worked for municipal Social Welfare departments. She began aiding Jews soon after the German invasion in 1939, by leading a group of co-workers who created more than 3,000 false documents to help Jewish families. This work was done at huge risk, as — since October 1941 — giving any kind of assistance to Jews in German-occupied Poland was punishable by death, not just for the person who was providing the help but also for their entire family or household. Poland was the only country in German-occupied Europe in which such a death penalty was applied.</p>

                    <p class="justified-text">As an employee of the Social Welfare Department, she had a special permit to enter the Warsaw Ghetto to check for signs of typhus, a disease the Germans feared would spread beyond the Ghetto. During these visits, she wore a Star of David as a sign of solidarity with the Jewish people. Under the pretext of conducting inspections of sanitary conditions within the Ghetto, Sendler and her co-workers smuggled out babies and small children, sometimes in ambulances and trams, sometimes hiding them in packages and suitcases, and using various other means.</p>

                    <p class="justified-text">In 1943 Sendler was arrested by the Gestapo and severely tortured. The Gestapo beat her brutally, fracturing her feet and legs in the process. Despite this, she refused to betray any of her comrades or the children they rescued, and was sentenced to death by firing squad. Żegota saved her life by bribing the guards on the way to her execution. After her escape, she hid from the Germans, but returned to Warsaw under a fake name and continued her involvement with the Żegota. During the Warsaw Uprising, she worked as a nurse in a public hospital, where she hid five Jews. She continued to work as a nurse until the Germans left Warsaw, retreating before the advancing Soviet troops. After the war, she and her co-workers gathered all of the children's records with the names and locations of the hidden Jewish children and gave them to their Żegota colleague Adolf Berman and his staff at the Central Committee of Polish Jews. However, almost all of the children's parents had been killed at the Treblinka extermination camp or had gone missing.</p>

                    <h4>Later life</h4>
                    <hr class="standardLine">
                    <p class="justified-text"> Irena Sendler lived in Warsaw for the remainder of her life. She died on 12 May 2008, aged 98, and is buried in Warsaw's Powązki Cemetery.</p>
