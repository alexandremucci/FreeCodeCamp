<!-- 

Remember that you can attach classes to HTML elements by using class="your-class-here" within the relevant element's opening tag.

Remember that CSS class selectors require a period at the beginning like this:

.blue-text {
  color: blue;
}

But also remember that class declarations don't use a period, like this:

<h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

Apply the red-text class to your h2 and p elements.
