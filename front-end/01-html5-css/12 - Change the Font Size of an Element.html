<!-- 

Font size is controlled by the font-size CSS property, like this:

h1 {
  font-size: 30px;
}

Create a second p element after the existing p element with the following kitty ipsum text: Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.

Inside the same style tag that contains your red-text class, create an entry for p elements and set the font-size to 16 pixels (16px).

Note
Due to browser implementation differences, you may need to be at 100% zoom to pass the tests on this challenge.

Also, please do not add a class attribute to your new p element.
